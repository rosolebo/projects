  {//question-001
	  q:'A nurse assessing a patient with HF would expect to find',

	  'an MI.',
	  'a pulmonary embolism.'],
	  answer:1	  
  },
  {//question-002
	  q:'Calcium is needed in the cardiac muscle',
	  options:['to break apart actin–myosin bridges.',
	  'to activate troponin.',
	  'to promote contraction via sliding.',
	  'to maintain the electrical rhythm.'],
	  answer:2		  
  },
  {//question-003
	  q:'When assessing a patient with right-sided HF, the nurse would expect to find edema',
	  options:['in gravity-dependent areas.',
	  'in the hands and fingers.',
	  'around the eyes.',
	  'when the patient is lying down.'],
	  answer:0		  
  },
  {//question-004
	  q:'ACE inhibitors and other vasodilators are used in the early treatment of HF. They act to',
	  options:['decrease workload on the heart by lowering preload and afterload.',
	  'increase arterial pressure and perfusion.',
	  'cause pooling of the blood and decreased venous return to the heart.',
	  ' increase the release of aldosterone and improve fluid balance.'],

  },
  {//question-005
	  q:'A nurse is preparing to administer a prescribed cardiac glycoside to a patient based on the understanding that this group of drugs acts in which way?',
	  options:['They block the sympathetic nervous system.',
	  'They block the renin–angiotensin system.',
	  'They block the parasympathetic influence on the heart muscle.',
	  'They affect intracellular calcium levels in the heart muscle.'],
	  answer:3

	  q:'A nurse would instruct a patient taking Lanoxin (digoxin) for the treatment of HF to take which action?',
	  options:['Make up any missed doses the next day.',
	  'Report changes in heart rate.',
	  'Avoid exposure to the sun.',
	  'Switch to generic tablets if less expensive.'],

  {//question-007
	  q:'A nurse is about to administer Lanoxin to a patient whose apical pulse is 48 beats/min. He or she should',
	  options:['administer the drug and notify the prescriber that the heart rate is low.',
	  'retake the pulse in 15 minutes and give the drug if the pulse has not changed.',
	  'retake the pulse in 1 hour and withhold the drug if the pulse is still less than 60 beats/min.',
	  'withhold the drug and notify the prescriber that the heart rate is below 60 beats/min.'],

  {//question-008
	  q:'How does ivabradine (Corlanor) work in the body?',
	  options:['Blocks beta-receptors to slow the heart rate',
	  'Slows influx of calcium to decrease force of contraction',
	  'Slows influx of calcium and relaxes blood vessels',
	  'Reduces heart rate by inhibiting action potentials at the SA node'],
