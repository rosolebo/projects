                <div><h4>#1 - Registered Nurse</h4>
                    <h4>Average Salary: $65,900</h4>
                    
                    Registered nurses (RNs) assess and evaluate patient 
                    conditions, and then plan, implement, provide, and 
                    document patient care in a manner that follows 
                    professional nursing standards and outlined practices. 
                    RNs usually do all of this in conjuction with doctors, 
                    nursing assistants, and other healthcare professionals. 
                    RNs oftentimes have a specialty; common specialties 
                    include labor and delivery, oncology, critical care, 
                    medical-surgical, and much more. Most RNs work in 
                    state, local, or private hospitals.

                    <h4>#2 - Chiropractor</h4>
                    <h4>Average Salary: $58,800</h4>
                    Chiropractors are healthcare professionals who use 
                    techniques to alleviate problems in their patients' 
                    neuromusculoskeletal systems. They perform spinal 
                    adjustments, use massage therapy, and even 
                    techniques such as ultrasound to reduce the pain 
                    or tension that their patients experience. Many 
                    chiropractors work in private chiropractic practices 
                    but some specialize in particular areas, sports, for 
                    instance, which requires them to work as part of a 
                    larger team of medical and healthcare professionals 
                    for a particular team or company.
