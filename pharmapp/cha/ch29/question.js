  {//question-001
	  q:'When describing the functions of the ANS, which would the instructor include?',
	  options:['Maintenance of balance and posture',
	  'Maintenance of the special senses',
	  'Regulation of integrated internal body functions',
	  'Coordination of peripheral and central nerve pathways'],
	  answer:2	  
  },
  {//question-002
	  q:'The ANS differs from other systems in the CNS in that it',
	  options:['uses only peripheral pathways.',
	  'affects organs and muscles via a two-neuron system.',
	  'uses a unique one-neuron system.',
	  'bypasses the CNS in all of its actions.'],
	  answer:1		  
  },
  {//question-003
	  q:'If you suspect that a person is very stressed and is experiencing a sympathetic stress reaction, you would expect to find',
	  options:['increased bowel sounds and urinary output.',
	  'constricted pupils and warm, flushed skin.',
	  'slow heart rate and decreased systolic blood pressure.',
	  'dilated pupils and elevated systolic blood pressure.'],
	  answer:3		  
  },
  {//question-004
	  q:'The nurse determines that the beta2-receptors in the SNS have been stimulated by which finding?',
	  options:['Increased heart rate',
	  'Increased myocardial contraction',
	  'Bronchial dilation',
	  'Uterine contraction'],
	  answer:2		  
  },
  {//question-005
	  q:'Once a postganglionic receptor site has been stimulated, the neurotransmitter must be broken down immediately. The sympathetic system breaks down postganglionic neurotransmitters by using',
	  options:['liver enzymes and acetylcholinesterase.',
	  'acetylcholinesterase and MAO.',
	  'COMT and liver enzymes.',
	  'MAO and COMT.'],
	  answer:3	  
  },
  {//question-006
	  q:'The parasympathetic nervous system, in most situations, opposes the actions of the SNS, allowing the ANS to',
	  options:['generally have no effect.',
	  'maintain a fine control over internal homeostasis.',
	  'promote digestion.',
	  'respond to stress most effectively.'],
	  answer:1,

  {//question-007
	  q:'Cholinergic neurons, those using ACh as their neurotransmitter, would be least likely to be found in',
	  options:['motor nerves on skeletal muscles.',
	  'preganglionic nerves in the sympathetic and parasympatheticsystems.',
	  'postganglionic nerves in the parasympathetic system.',
	  'the adrenal medulla.'],

  },
  {//question-008
	  q:'Stimulation of the parasympathetic nervous system would cause',
	  options:['slower heart rate and increased GI secretions.',
	  'faster heart rate and urinary retention.',
	  'vasoconstriction and bronchial dilation.',
	  'pupil dilation and muscle paralysis.'],
