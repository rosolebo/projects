    "A fracture that has displacement from its normal alignment",
    "A fracture that does not break through the surface of the skin",
    "A fracture that breaks through the skin surface to the exterior of the body",
    "A fracture that results from a disease process rather than undue stress or trauma as other fractures do.",
